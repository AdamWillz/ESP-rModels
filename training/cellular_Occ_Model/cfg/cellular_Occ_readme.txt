The model constitute of four identical zones:
1-manager_a, it has the basic occupant representation. 
2-manager_b,  has the dynamic two node model (core/skin) occupant representation. 
3-manager_E+, occupant heat loads are calculated using the energyPlus polynomial equation.
4-manager_ASH occupant heat loads are calculated using ESP-r polynomial equations (sensible and latent polynomial function of operative temperature and metabolic rate).
