Notes on model DFD files:

test_space_initial.dfd - Initial 11 x 7 x 8 grid auto generation prior
  to specification of any volumes

test_space_med.dfd - Medium resolution 17 x 7 x 15 prior to specification
  of any volumes.

test_space_high.dfd - High resolution 29 x 10 x 20 prior to volumes

test_space_16_5_10.dfd - Adapted auto gen 16 x 5 x 10 (200mm cells)
  prior to volume definition

test_space_16_5_10a.dfd - 16x5x10 grid with a few solids added

test_space_16_5_10b.dfd - 16x5x10 grid with solids & air added

test_space_16_5_10_decoupled.dfd - with wall temperatures specified
  at 20C and solved via fixed edy no buy. Flat lines on solution and the
  flow vectors are very simple.

test_space_16_5_10_decoupled_dt.dfd - with wall temperature specified
  (each a bit different) solved via MIT with bouy. Mostly flat lines
  on solution, flow vectors more interesting with drift down. 

test_space_16_5_10_decoupled_ke.dfd - with wall temperatures specified
  and 50W added at floor solved via k-e with bouyancy and temperature
  calculated. This might be the most complex/accurate. Patterns seem
  visually correct. Relaxaction parameter sensitive.
