These images were created using the program ParaView. ParaView is free and
open-source software, and ESP-r has functionality to output CFD results
in a format compatible with ParaView (just enter the CFD portion of the
res module, load in the CFD results library and toggle to ParaView file 
format). As well as the directional glyphs and streamlines demonstrated 
here ParaView can create contour plots, cut planes, and many other 
visualisations. Different visualisations can also be layered on top of 
one another, and animations through time can be created.
