The flow network blower_teste.cfg includes a rough building-as-room
with volume and surface area equivalent to that used in a blower
door tesst. It can also be run as a pure-mfs model.  The
1mmx15mcr component (1mm x 15m crack) gives ~280m^3/hr with 50PA
difference between room and outside.

There are three parallel sets of nodes house-right0 were for initial test.
house_a-right_a uses single 1mmx10mcr component and the
house_b-right_b uses single 1mmx15mcr component and the
house_c-right_c has muliple cracks which add up to 15m to check
that they give the same total flow.  And they do so the
method is:

a) setup a zone with correct volume and ~correct area set it at 50PA
and another outside node at fixed 0PA.  Create a range of components
and connect them in parallel.  See which is close to the blower door
test value.
b) take the closest and create 2nd pair of 50PA 0PA nodes and link
with the close component. This double checks that the flow is correct.

c) if b correct create a series of shorter cracks which total the same
   length. Apportion via the exposed facade area in each zone of the
   model. So if b is 10m length the collection of short cracks will add
   to 10m.

Run assessment via mfs and check that flow through house_b and house_c
pairs are close.
